## Create tasks

There are a number of important elements the tasks need to have to work well with jsPsychR, so we recommend to use one of the systems we have developed to help with this.

For example, with the function `create_protocol()`, you can create new tasks as part of a fully working protocol to be able to test them using csv files for the items and html files for the instructions.  

There are some important things to take into account:   

- The tasks_folder expects a folder with sub-folders with the ShortName of tasks. Inside, they need to have a csv file and html files  

- The csv file (ShortName.csv) needs to have an ID and plugin columns, and then columns by the name of parameters used in the plugin  

- For each html file (ShortName_instructions.html, ShortName_instructions2.html, etc) an instructions page will be created. If there is no html, a default page will be used  

You can run the fully reproducible example included in jsPsychMaker. It uses the files from `admin/example_tasks_new_protocol/`:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Source functions
invisible(lapply(list.files("./R", full.names = TRUE, pattern = ".R$"), source))

# Create protocol
create_protocol(tasks_folder = "admin/example_tasks_new_protocol/", 
                folder_output = "admin/OUTPUT/NEW", 
                launch_browser = TRUE)

```





## Help with new tasks {#HelpNewtasks}
If you need help developing new tasks, you can [open a new Issue in the jsPsychMaker Github](https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychMaker/issues).

We will ask you to add the details about the task in the [NEW tasks document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LAsyTZ2ZRP_xLiUBkqmawwnKWgy8OCwq4mmWrrc_rpQ/edit#gid=0).

Once the task is implemented, our goal is to always end up having a sister task preparation script in [jsPsychHelpeR](https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychHelpeR). You can try [to create the preparation script](#create-new-tasks) and do a Pull request, or ask for help [opening a new Issue in the jsPsychHelpeR Github](https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychHelpeR/issues).


## How to fill the NEW tasks document

---  

[NEW tasks document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LAsyTZ2ZRP_xLiUBkqmawwnKWgy8OCwq4mmWrrc_rpQ/edit#gid=0)  

---  

First of all, you will need the original paper where the task was validated/translated to have all the details at hand. Please, send us a link to the paper.  

The best way to fill the [NEW tasks document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LAsyTZ2ZRP_xLiUBkqmawwnKWgy8OCwq4mmWrrc_rpQ/edit#gid=0) is:  

1. Find a task similar to yours in the document [Tareas jsPsychR](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Eo0F4GcmqWZ1cghTpQlA4aHsc8kTABss-HAeimE2IqA/edit#gid=0) where we have information about all the available tasks.  

2. Copy/paste the information from all the tabs to the [NEW tasks document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LAsyTZ2ZRP_xLiUBkqmawwnKWgy8OCwq4mmWrrc_rpQ/edit#gid=0) and adapt it.  



Try to be as consistent as possible. For example, when entering the information about numeric conversion in the Puntajes_items tab:

    All the cells must be:  
    1 = Mucho  
    2 = Poco  
    ...

DO NOT do things like:

    1: Mucho  
    1 Mucho  
    1 pto = Mucho  
    Mucho 1  

Please, make sure you fill out all the details in all the tabs.
