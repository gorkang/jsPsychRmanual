[![](img/GitHub32.png) jsPsychMonkeys](https://github.com/gorkang/jsPsychMonkeys): Release monkeys to a jsPsych experiment using the R package {targets}, docker and {RSelenium}.

---  

With jsPsychMonkeys you can simulate participants and easily do the following:

- Simulate participants online and offline

- Simulate participants sequentially and in parallel

- Ask your Monkeys to take pictures of each screen

- Make the behavior of the Monkeys reproducible setting a random seed associated with their unique id

- Store logs of the process, including console logs with errors

- Watch your participants randomly click things in VNC 


---  

**See [QuickGuide](#QuickGuidejsPsychMonkeys) for basic instructions.**

## How to simulate participants

If the [QuickGuide](#QuickGuidejsPsychMonkeys) configuration steps didn't work... You may need to do one of the things below:  

- Run participants manually  

- Use a Linux computer or create a Linux partition  

- Create a Linux virtual machine from where to simulate participants. You can use [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to install [Ubuntu](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). Once there, you can use this [manual to prepare the system to run R & RStudio](https://gorkang.github.io/R_preparacion_visualizacion_datos/preparando-sistema.html#empezando-en-a-b-c)  

<!-- sudo apt install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev  -->




## Parameters

Edit the `Parameters` section of the `_targets.R` file. The minimal set of parameters needed are:  

```
parameters_monkeys_minimal = list(
  uid = 1:10, # User id's for the participants. 
  local_folder_tasks = "Downloads/tests/2" # Location of your jsPsych protocol
)
```

---  

### Release the Monkeys! 

If you want a sequential process: 

- `targets::tar_make()`  

If you want a parallel horde of monkeys: 

- `targets::tar_future_make(workers = 2)`

You can set as many parallel workers as you want. With `targets::tar_make_future(workers = future::availableCores() - 1)` you can have as many workers as your computer cores minus 1.

In `run.R` you can see the typical set of commands needed for a variety of situations.  

---  

10 Monkeys completing a protocol in parallel. You can use `targets::tar_watch(seconds = 10, outdated = FALSE, targets_only = TRUE)` to see the live progress:

### Launch monkeys on a server

You will need a `.vault/SERVER_PATH.R` file that contains the path where the protocols are located in your server: `server_path = "http://URL_OF_YOUR_SERVER/PROTOCOLS_GENERAL_FOLDER/"`  

With the `server_folder_tasks` you will set the subfolder where the protocol is located. In the example below the monkeys would go to, `http://URL_OF_YOUR_SERVER/PROTOCOLS_GENERAL_FOLDER/1`  

```
parameters_monkeys_minimal = list(
  uid = 1:10, # User id's for the participants. 
  server_folder_tasks = "1" # Location of your jsPsych protocol
)
```


### Parameters for parameters_monkeys_minimal

There are a few parameters that can be useful:  

- `uid_URL = TRUE`: The uid is passed in the URL (e.g. `&uid=1`)  

- `local_folder_tasks = rep("Downloads/tests/test_prototol", 25)`: Passing a vector of multiple tasks will make the monkeys to complete all of them.  

- `keep_alive = TRUE` Keep the docker container alive after completing the tasks  

- `DEBUG = TRUE` Activate DEBUG mode. Lot's of stuff will show up in the console.  

- `open_VNC = TRUE` Activate DEBUG mode and open a VNC container to see the monkey's progress.  

- `screenshot = TRUE` The monkeys will take a picture of all the pages they see. The .png files are stored in `outputs/screenshots`  

- `debug_file = TRUE` Activate DEBUG mode and store all the console output in the `outputs/log`  

- `big_container = TRUE` Sets the Shared memory size (/dev/shm) to 2 gigabytes. This is useful to avoid long/complex protocols to crash

- `disable_web_security = TRUE` If you are running a local protocol that loads external files (e.g. consent form in a html file), you may need this. Only works with Google Chrome.

- `console_logs = TRUE` Store the browser's console logs. Only works with Google Chrome

- `forced_random_wait = TRUE` Will wait a randomly sampled number of seconds on page 4

- `forced_seed = 11` Set a random seed so the Monkeys' behavior will be fully reproducible

- `forced_refresh = 20` Refresh browser in page 20 (if TRUE is given, it will refresh in a randomly sampled page)



#### Parameters details

- `local_folder_tasks`: If the folder is not accessible to Docker (anything outside the Download folder), jsPsychMonkeys will create a copy of the protocol in `Downloads/JSPSYCH/`
